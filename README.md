Theemwiz Front-End Project

This project is a responsive landing page section built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. It features a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly layout inspired by a provided Figma design.

I developed this section as part of a technical round, focusing on accurately implementing the design and maintaining responsiveness across devices.

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in your browser or code editor.

Note: The original images from the design were unclear, so I used sample images as placeholders. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

This project reflects my growing skills in front-end development and attention to detail in translating UI designs into functional code.
