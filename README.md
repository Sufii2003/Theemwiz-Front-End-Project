# Theemwiz-Front-End-Project
This project is a responsive landing page section built with Bootstrap 5. It features a modern, mobile-friendly layout.
I created this landing section using an HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in your code editor.
This is part of my learning journey with HTML and CSS, and I’m happy with how it turned out!
I didn’t get the actual images clearly, so I used sample ones — if there’s any issue with them, sorry for that!
